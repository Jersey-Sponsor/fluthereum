# Fluthereum

## Description

Flutter example project to run Solidity smart contracts using web3Dart library

## Dependencies
### web3dart:
A dart library that connects to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It connects to an Ethereum node to send transactions, interact with smart contracts and much more!

#### Features 
* Connect to an Ethereum node with the rpc-api, call common methods
* Send signed Ethereum transactions
* Generate private keys, setup new Ethereum addresses
* Call functions on smart contracts and listen for contract events
* Code generation based on smart contract ABI for easier interaction

## About Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

Solidity is a curly-bracket language. It is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript, and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). You can find more details about which languages Solidity has been inspired by in the language influences section.
